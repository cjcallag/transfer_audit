This document was developed to support the goals of the FORA property transfer audit. The data on properties initially transfered to FORA came from the fortordsafety.com. In order to update the status of this properties, the ESCA staff audited these parcels to uncover the current owner.
  
<table style = "border: 1px black solid;"><tr><td style = "padding: 10px; text-align: left; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-size: 12px;">
**Note:** The shapes and position of the Army COE parcels is not a perfect match to the County of Monterey's APN parcels. As such, the data collection team had to make qualitative determinations to transform some COE numbers to APN numbers.
